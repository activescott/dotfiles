# dotfiles

Just my personal dotfiles. Move along...

I use these on zsh and bash on macOS and Linux. At one point they worked on windows, but I rarely use them there.

## Installation

I use `script/setup` copy everything to home directory (`~/`).

## Thanks

I pick up so much from so many places over the years related to dotfiles and shell scripting generally but most recently here are some useful places I found tricks:
