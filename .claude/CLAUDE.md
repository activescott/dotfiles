- Never skip signing of commits. If necessary wait on the user to authorize signing as needed
- When staging files for git, add specific files by name instead of using `git add -A` or `git add .`
- use lowercase variable names in bash when creating new variables
- Prefer jq and yq over python or scripts for parsing JSON/YAML on the command line
- Never run `minikube update-context` or other commands that change the global kubectl context. Use `kubectl --context minikube` to target minikube without modifying the global context.
- **BEFORE calling ExitPlanMode**, save the plan to `specs/<feature-name>/plan.md`. Context is lost after exiting plan mode, so the plan must be written to disk while still in plan mode.
- **When starting implementation of a plan** (e.g. the user pastes a plan into a fresh session after clearing context), save the plan to `specs/<feature-name>/plan.md` as the FIRST step before making any code changes. This is critical because the plan may only exist in the user's prompt and will be lost if not persisted.
- After finishing implementation of a plan, save a summary of what was done to `specs/<feature-name>/summary.md` alongside the plan file.
